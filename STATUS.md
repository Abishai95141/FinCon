# STATUS — progress tracker

**Read [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) first.** This file is the live state of the build. Update it every session, at the end of the session, with real command output.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Current phase** | `P0` — synthetic generator + ground truth |
| **Last green gate** | *none — nothing built yet* |
| **Build runs?** | No — skeleton only |
| **Last verified numbers** | *none* |
| **Updated** | 2026-08-20 |

## How to update this file

A gate is **green only when the command output that proves it is pasted below.** Not "looks right", not "should work" — the output. A gate with no output is `not started`, whatever the code looks like.

Status values: `not started` · `in progress` · `RED` (attempted, failing) · `GREEN` (output pasted below).

`RED` is a legitimate, useful state. Leaving a gate red with an honest note is correct. Marking it green without the output is the one thing that breaks this document — see CLAUDE.md rule 1.

## Phase gates

| Phase | Gate | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P0** | Generator emits batch A and B with complete labels; adversarial cases present; a second person can regenerate identical batches from a seed | `not started` | — |
| **P1** | Round-trip a hand-built journal through Beancount; an unbalanced entry is *rejected*; a wrong closing balance *blocks* the close | `not started` | — |
| **P2** | Both hand-written specs (CAMT, Shopify) ingest cleanly; a deliberately corrupted spec is caught by roll-forward, not inspection | `not started` | — |
| **P3** ◆ | **First number.** Auto-match rate + false-match rate, ours vs securo baseline, on batch A | `not started` | — |
| **P4** | Blocking recall measured against A's labels and printed on the scorecard | `not started` | — |
| **P5** | Planted ambiguous payout raises `E09`; solver timeouts surface as `E13`, never as silent non-matches | `not started` | — |
| **P6** ◆ | `make eval` produces the full 4-arm × 8-metric comparison on A and B from a clean checkout | `not started` | — |
| — | **◆ MINIMUM SHIPPABLE LINE** — everything below is upside | | |
| **P7** ◆ | **The lift number.** Resolve 3 on A, approve 3 rules, re-run on held-out B, scorecard attributes improvement rule by rule | `not started` | — |
| **P8** | An external process calls `run_match` and re-derives the returned proof without touching our database | `not started` | — |
| **P9** | A controller completes one close through the UI without a terminal | `not started` | — |
| **P10** | A second loop (GSTR-2B) closes with zero kernel code changed — profile and adapters only | `not started` | — |

◆ = the three gates that carry the claim. **P7 is not cuttable.**

## Evidence log

Paste gate output here as gates go green. Newest at the top. Keep the command, not just the result.

<!-- template:
### P3 — first number · 2026-MM-DD
```
$ make gate P=3
...actual output...
```
Notes: anything surprising, anything still weak.

*(empty — no gates green yet)*

## Known broken / known incomplete

Track anything that is failing, stubbed, or degraded. An empty section here while gates are red means this file is stale.

| Item | State | Phase that fixes it |
|---|---|---|
| Everything | Skeleton only — every module raises `NotImplementedError` naming its phase | P0–P10 |

---

## Residual risks we are carrying

From the [build plan](docs/03-BUILD-PLAN.md) problem register. These are **not** expected to close — they get reported on the scorecard and in the talk track.

| # | Risk | Current mitigation | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `P3` | Adapter correct on sample, wrong on tail | Roll-forward + control-total over every row; first-use approval | open |
| `P10` | Bounded subset-sum search finds one solution, misses a second | `enumerate_all_solutions`; report *unproven uniqueness* when the bound is hit | open |
| `P19` | Induced rule overfits — right on history, wrong on future | Regression gate; versioned, revocable rules | open, needs post-promotion monitoring |
| `P23` | Same team authored generator and engine | Adversarial set frozen at P0; never edited in the same commit as engine code | open — **state this limitation when reporting numbers** |

---

## Open decisions

Decisions not yet taken. Taking one means writing an ADR in `docs/decisions/`.

| Decision | Options | Blocking |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend for P9 | FastAPI+HTMX (planned) · minimal React | P9 |
| PageIndex integration for `E02` contract lookup | build · defer to v2 | P7, optional |
| Whether to adopt qm's TypeScript core | harvest patterns (current) · full adoption | post-v1 |

**Already decided and irreversible** — see `docs/decisions/`: adapters are declarative specs (ADR-001); contracts are semver'd from P1 (ADR-002).

---

## Next action

**Start P0.** Build `bench/generator/` — scenario composition, planted exceptions at known rates, complete labels by construction, seeded so batches regenerate identically. Author `bench/adversarial/` in the same phase, *before* any engine code exists.

The P0 gate is not "the generator runs." It is: a second person, given the seed, regenerates byte-identical batches, and the adversarial set contains cases nobody has built an engine for yet.
